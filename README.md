Fun, simple, educational App focused on understanding the sensors in your phone.

My first iOS Application with an emphasis on object orientatated and other good programming practices.

Features (Sensors):

Pressure, Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope, Proximity


I didn't truly get environmental variables working properly. I also don't have much comments.
